# The Smart Way â€” React + Vite + TypeScript

Port of your runnable HTML demo into a proper React project with TailwindCSS.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1) Install deps
npm install

# 2) Start dev server
npm run dev

# 3) Build for production
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- Tailwind is preconfigured.
- UI and logic are ported from your original prototype (drag/drop Time Worlds, SRS deck, Grammar Hack, etc.).
- All state is in-memory for now; you can wire an API next.
